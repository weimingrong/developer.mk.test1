Forestry supports storing your media in your own [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html).

## Link to your S3 Bucket

## AWS S3 Configuration

{{% tip %}} The S3 configuration can be rather overwhelming if you're unfamiliar with the service. For our use case it's safe to keep the defaults unless mentioned otherwise in the guide below. {{% /tip %}}

 1. [Sign up for an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)
 2. Log into your dashboard and open the _Services_ dropdown in the top bar, then pick the **S3** service.
 3. Click on **Create Bucket**, name it, remember the **Bucket name** for later and proceed to the _Set Permissions_ step.
 4. In the _Set Permissions_ step make sure to uncheck the following options:
    * **Block new public ACLs and uploading public objects**
    * **Remove public access granted through public ACLs**
 5. Review and create your Bucket.
 6. Create User Credentials for the new Bucket. Open _Services_ and select the **IAM** service.
 7. Navigate to _Users_ and click on **Add User**.
 8. Grant **Programmatic access** to create an _access key ID_ and _secret access key._
 9. Choose **Attach existing policies directly.** You'll need to click on **Create Policy** in the _Set Permissions_ step.
10. Name and set your permissions for your policy. Below is an example of the minimum permissions necessary for Forestry's Media Library.

11. Set your newly created policy as your user's permissions and finish the creation of your new user.

12. Take note of the **Access key ID** and the **Secret access key** and navigate to the _Media_ tab on your site's _Settings_ in Forestry
13. Select **Amazon** **S3** as a _Media Storage Provider_ and fill in the **Bucket**, **Access Key** and **Secret**. Click on _Save Media Settings_. You are now connected to your S3 bucket. You can now upload an image in the _Media_ section to test your connection.

{{% warning %}}

Currently, Forestry needs to be able to upload public objects to your S3 bucket in order to display them in the media library (_see Step 4_). We plan to remove this requirement in a future update.

## Recommended Path Settings

You will want to adjust your paths in the **Media** section to work with S3.

* **Public Path**: You should enter the full URL to your S3 bucket.  
  `https://{{ BUCKET_NAME }}.s3.{{ AWS_REGION }}.amazonaws.com`
  * AWS REGION format (e.g. `us-west-2)` is consistent across regions with the exception of the `us-east-1` (North Virginia) region which can be omitted as it is the default one. ([full region list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#region-names-codes))  
    To check your public path, upload a media to your bucket, and check its full URL.
* **Front Matter Path:** Activate the toggle in this section to use a different **public path** when inserting an image into front matter.

## Migrating Existing Media

Currently, we are not able to automatically migrate existing media from a Git repo to a user's AWS S3 Bucket. We recommend logging in to your AWS console, select your Bucket and bulk upload your images there. After the images are in your Bucket, they will also appear in your Media Library in Forestry if they are public.

Unfortunately, for the time being, you will need to manually update your front matter to reassign the new images.

## Additional Resources

Here we list a few resources that might be helpful for your S3 implementation. Different from dedicated image services (e.g. Cloudinary), S3 needs some additional setup to make eager and lazy image manipulations possible.

### Image Manipulation

* [Basic Architecture for lazy image processing](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/resize-images-on-the-fly-with-amazon-s3-aws-lambda-and-amazon-api-gateway/)
* [Production-Ready Solution with Serverless-Image-Handler](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/web-applications/serverless-image-handler/)
* [Use a third-party service such as Imgix for image handling](https://docs.imgix.com/setup/serving-images)

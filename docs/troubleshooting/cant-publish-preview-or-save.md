When previewing, or saving a draft, there are a multitude of reasons why your site may fail to import. Generally, they boil down to 3 reasons:

* Your content files are improperly formatted.
* Your layout files are improperly formatted or have a build error.
* Your permissions on the repository have changed
* Our service messed up. Our bad.

We output the error the caused the import to fail and allow you to view it in order to help you debug.

To find this error, look for the failure message in your `Site Activity`, located in the sidebar beside the logo.

Inside the failure message you will see a `Failed, Show Log` button. Clicking this button will open new page with the error that caused the action to fail.
As a site admin your can check the preview logs to get more information about the error and what file is triggering it.
If you're an editor, reach out to your site admin.

## Bug Fixes

* **Default Values:** Fixed a bug where default values were not being set when creating documents.

## Enhancements

* **Settings Navigation:** Mobile view for Settings removes the tabs in favour of a dropdown field.
* **Preview Errors Notification:** The notification for preview errors now contains a link to our [troubleshooting](https://forestry.io/docs/previews/troubleshooting-preview-issues/ "Troubleshooting Preview Problems") doc.
* **Document Sorting:** Started to [persist the document sorting method](https://portal.productboard.com/forestry/c/34-sort-section-by-date-by-default "Forestry Roadmap") between visits.
* **Media View:** Started to persist the media view preference between visits.

## Performance

* **Preload and Caching Data:** Improved preloading allows us to take advantage of the caching in the frontend. The data for the _Media Manager_ and any _Directory Sections_ are no now preloaded and cached to keep the app responsive.

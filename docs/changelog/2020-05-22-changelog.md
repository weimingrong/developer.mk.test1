title: 2020/05/22 Changelog
summary: Faster page loading, easier signup, better error messages and various fixes

---
A bunch of improvements and fixes this week to make your experience in Forestry always more enjoyable.

## Enhancements

* **Faster document loading**: we optimized the way we load pages, it should feel faster now. 🚀
* **Password strength meter**: we ask our users to pick up strong passwords or passphrases to secure their accounts. If you don't use a password manager to help you with that, we added real-time feedback on sign up to let you know about our password requirements and make the experience smoother. 🔐

* **Better error message for invalid front matter:** we now display the filename and line number in the site activity when we detect invalid front matter. ⚠️

## Fixes

* **Menus:** fix display of deeply nested menu items for Jekyll and Hugo

description: Hot Module Replacement üî• and zero-config instant previews.
summary: >
  Hot module Replacement üî•, zero-config [instant previews](/docs/instant-previews), new starters and archive unactive personal sites.

---
Forestry CMS never felt so fast to use, while instant previews really deserve their naming.

## Enhancements

* **Hot Module Replacement üöÄ:** You can now decide if Instant Previews should do a full refresh or if you prefer to [rely on your static site generator Hot Module Replacement capability](https://forestry.io/docs/previews/instant-previews/#hot-module-replacement "How to opt in for HMR Previews in Forestry").
  For Gatsby, Gridsome, NuxtJS or NextJS sites it will also ensure [the preview stays on the currently edited page](https://www.loom.com/share/aaccc79de8b240d78c4f3739798f1708 "HMR Preview with a Gatsby Site on Forestry").
* **Zero config instant previews ‚ú®:** For static site generators using a default port other than `8080`, you don't need to pass any more options to your preview command: the default `develop` command should do. Forestry will do all the network binding behind the scene. People importing Gatsby themes from [Stackbit](https://app.stackbit.com/create?cms=forestry "Import a Stackbit theme to Forestry") can now use previews right away.
* **New starters**: [Parsa](https://github.com/forestryio/hugo-parsa-forestry) (Hugo), [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/DirtyF/jekyll-minimal-mistakes-forestry) (Jekyll).
* To save precious resources ‚ôªÔ∏è on our servers, Forestry will now archive **personal sites** after a long period of inactivity. You will be prompted to restore an archived site if you didn't log or edit content for 3 months. Organization sites remain always active and are not impacted by this change.

### Fixes

* **Duplicate** files: Forestry now names a duplicated document with the new `title` entered.

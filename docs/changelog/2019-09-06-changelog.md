### New starters

Newcomers can now [pick one of our starters](https://forestry.io/starters/ "Get started with Forestry") for Gatsby, Gridsome, Eleventy, Next, VuePress, Hugo or Jekyll.

Starters are the easiest way to show how Forestry displays content sections, data files and how to configure Instant previews.

If you're a theme developer and that yo have a nice working theme setup ready for Forestry, feel free to [submit your starter](https://github.com/forestryio/forestry.io/issues/new?assignees=DirtyF&labels=starter&template=starter.md&title=New+starter+submission).

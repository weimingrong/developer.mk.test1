## Bug Fixes

* **Create Document Form:** Fixed bug that causes the form to be reset "randomly".
* **Readonly Documents:** No longer are locked when being viewed.
* **Logo:** Started suppressing console error that isn't actually a problem.
* **Menus:** Fixed issue where menu item weights would sometimes get jumbled after adding a new item.
* **Jekyll Previews:** Fixed an issue which caused Jekyll previews to not open at the correct URL.

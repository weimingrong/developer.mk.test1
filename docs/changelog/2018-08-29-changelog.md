## Enhancements

* **Directory Sections:** A new `exclude` glob can be set to exclude files from your directory sections.
* **Jekyll Pages Sections:** Forestry now respects the `exclude` field found in your [Jekyll config](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/ "Jekyll Configuration").
* **Block Labels:** You can now label your blocks by setting the Display Field on your fmt partials.

## Bug Fixes

* **Bitbucket SSH Setup:** During the setup of a new Bitbucket repo, Forestry now links directly to the Bitbucket page where you can upload the SSH key.

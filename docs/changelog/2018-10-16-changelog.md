## Sunsets

* **Data Files:** We changed the way we handle data files. They are now imported using contenct sections.

## Enhancements

* **Deployment Logs:** Forestry now collects logs from deployment and makes them available through the Notification UI.
* **Sidebar Settings:** The list of sections now contains more information about the type of section and the content it includes.
* **Site Brand:** The Forestry Logo inside the CMS now behaves like a link i.e. Ctrl/Cmd+Click will open the Forestry Dashboard in a new tab.

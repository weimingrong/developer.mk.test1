## Enhancements

* [**Breadcrumbs for directory sections**](https://portal.productboard.com/forestry/1-forestry-io-roadmap/c/83-improve-navigation-within-sections) ease the navigation from deep nested folders.
* [**Limit characters on text and textarea fields**](https://portal.productboard.com/forestry/1-forestry-io-roadmap/c/81-characters-limit-on-text-and-textarea-fields) is useful to enforce SEO best practices for instance.
* **Less verbose commits**: we now force the pages sorting in your front matter templates, to minimize diffs and ease content reviews. üëì
* We now [check for the front template filename](https://portal.productboard.com/forestry/1-forestry-io-roadmap/c/84-prevent-overriding-front-matter-templates) to prevent overrides.
* All Hugo images are now running Go 1.13, it means if you're using Hugo > 0.56.0 you are now able to [use **Hugo modules**](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/)**.**

### Starters

* **Novela**: a [beautiful new Hugo starter](https://github.com/forestryio/novela-hugo-starter) adapted from Narative ([preview](https://hugo-novela-forestry.netlify.com/))
* Our [VuePress portfolio template](https://github.com/forestryio/portfolio-vuepress) has been updated to use version 1.2.0 to fix an issue with Instant Previews.
* [Gridsome Forestry starter](https://github.com/itsnwa/gridsome-forestry-starter) has been updated to use version 0.7 to fix an issue with Instant Previews.

Thanks for all the helpful feedback to make Forestry better üôè

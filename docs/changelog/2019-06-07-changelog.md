## Enhancements

* **Teams (starter plan)**: Allow organizations to handle teams and collaborators to better define permissions on sites.
* **Conditional for template fields (alpha)** : Choose to conditionally render a field based on the value of a sibling field. Currently only works with two field types: Bool or Select field.
* **Page Select** : Alphabetically sort Documents in the "Page Select" dropdown.

## Bug fixes

* **Menus:** Fixed an issue where you couldn't turn update a menu-item to an internal link from an external link.
* **Media:** Fixed a button where the delete media button was hidden in Safari.
* **Media:** Fixed an issue where changing the media provider in the settings would be reset after clicking on the page.
* **Dates:** Fixed an issue where dates in some formats would show up as `[Object, object]` after saving a document.
* **Page Select** : When you change the section in the page-select configuration, the list of pages now updates.

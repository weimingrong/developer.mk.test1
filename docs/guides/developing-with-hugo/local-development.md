Hugo allows you to work on your site in a local environment on your computer. It requires you to install the Hugo binary on your local machine.

For detailed instructions on installing Hugo for your operating system, see the [Hugo Docs][1].

## Working with Git
If you set up and imported your site with Git, local development becomes much easier. We recommend you do this.

To get started, clone your repository to your desktop. For example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/forestryio/hugo-demo.git
```

Now you can begin working on your site. Any changes made to your site can be committed in Git, and will automatically be synced with your Forestry CMS.

## Serving your site locally
Hugo comes with a `livereload` local development server built into itâ€™s binary. This will allow you to develop locally on your machine, and will automatically rebuild your site and refresh the browser as you make changes.

To run Hugo with the server, run the command:

```sh
hugo server
```

This will spin up a local development server with live reload at the port `1313`, which is accessible from `http://localhost:1313`.

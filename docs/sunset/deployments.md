{{<warning>}}
**Forestry deprecated deployment options since January 31st, 2020**
{{</warning>}}

Deployment options are not available within Forestry anymore.

Here is our list of recommended alternatives:

[Deploy with Buddy Works](https://buddy.works/docs/deployments)

[Deploy with Circle CI](https://forestry.io/blog/automate-deploy-w-circle-ci/)

[Deploy with GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

[Deploy with Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/)

[Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/introduction/)

### Why this change?

Only a small percentage of our users made use of Forestry deployments. For those users, we spent a lot of effort ensuring build and deployments work. We now prefer to focus on our core features like content modeling, performance, stability, editing experience, etc. Plus, dedicated services are doing a far better job at deployment and allow for scheduled jobs for instance; we think our customers will be better off using those services.

Even if the current option has served you well until now, we think it's a smart move for everyone.

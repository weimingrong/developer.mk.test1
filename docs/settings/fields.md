## Blocks

A _Blocks_ field is similar to a Repeatable Field Group, except that it supports _unlike_ objects. Blocks fields are great for things like dynamic page layouts: a series of sections where each section may consist of different fields.

![](/uploads/2019/10/blocks-content-ui.png)

Blocks fields work by including _other_ front matter templates. You specify which templates can be used in your blocks field when creating the Front Matter Template. When adding content to a Blocks field, you can select which of these templates to add from a dropdown.

```toml
+++
[[blocks]]
background_style = "Brand Color"
heading = "Features"
size = "Small"
template = "hero-section"
[[blocks]]
background_style = "Light"
content = "[Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is a modern, responsive CSS framework with a flexbox-based grid system. "
heading = "Built With Bulma"
image = "/uploads/2018/04/19/bulma-logo.png"
image_position = "Left"
template = "media-feature"
+++
```

[See detailed documentation](/docs/settings/fields/blocks)

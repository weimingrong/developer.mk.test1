Forestry allows you to move your imported Git branches from your sites to an organization and vice-versa.

{{% tip "Site or Branch?" %}}
When you import a branch from a repository, it creates a Forestry site.
A site in Forestry is a Git branch, with settings, templates and access permissions.
{{% /tip %}}


## Transfer a site

1. Navigate to a site on your Dashboard (e.g. "My Sites"). Select the branch and click on the "..." options menu, and select "Transfer Branch". 
2. Choose where you want to move this site:  "My sites" or an "Organization". When you select "Organization", you are able to choose the destination from the dropdown menu, then click on "Transfer" to confirm.

{{% tip Roles %}}
You can only transfer sites to Organizations if your role for that Organization permits it. See [user roles](/docs/settings/collaborators/#site-access-levels)

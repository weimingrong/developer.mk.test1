If you are on the **personal** plan and you **didn't edit a site in Forestry for more than three months**, we will automatically archive your custom CMS admin user interface in order to save some precious resources on our production servers.

Don't worry site admins can always **restore** an archived CMS admin in two clicks the next time you need to edit your site.   
As Forestry is completely decoupled from your Git repository and your hosting provider, your public website is not affected.

### How to restore your admin?

Click on the site or branch marked as _archived_ and click on the **Restore now** button.![Restore archived site dialog](/uploads/2020/06/restore-modal.png)

Your branch or site imported in Forestry is now active again.
